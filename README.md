# Matt Bowytz
real-time dashboard

## Instructions
- site lives at https://matty-digital.github.io/real-time
- should look ok on most platforms
- I suggest chrome or safari when viewing/testing

### DEV
- clone this repo
- be sure to work off of a branch, pushing to master deploys site
- hack away
- `github pages` forces https, so any new external assets must be https
- very simple here, no servers or anything fancy like that
- all the data is fake, random numbers
- but the waves are real

### OPS
- like I said, very simple here
- master branch is using `github pages`
- pushing to the master branch will trigger a new release
- small site, so the build takes no time at all

Please contact @matty-digital with any questions
